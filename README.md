# cv

I used Kieran Healy's [kjh-vita](https://github.com/kjhealy/kjh-vita) template, with only minor tweaks to reduce its functionality. You can find the [PDF of my CV in this repository](https://github.com/ianmilligan1/cv/blob/master/milligan-cv.pdf).

Synced with my website at [https://ianmilligan.ca/cv/](https://ianmilligan.ca/cv/) via Google Docs, "upload new version" to avoid having to manually tweak anything else.
